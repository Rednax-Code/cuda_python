# cuda_python
Library which makes it easy to use pre-compiled compute shaders like normal python functions.
The idea is nice, but in practice a bit useless.
It essentially just a more beginner vriendly version of the c-types library, but then it (partly) forces data transfer between gpu and cpu, which is very slow.
